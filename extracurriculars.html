    <h4>I pride myself on being an all-rounder! Growing up, I was a very energetic child and my frustrated parents were
        looking for a way to channel my energy in a constructive manner<br>
        Luckily, I loved the outdoors and I took an instant liking to swimming and tennis! I used to read a lot- which
        greatly improved my general knowledge and helped me immensely in all those quizzes!<br>
        I also have an interest in math- having leant abacus and attending math classes at Bhaskaracharya Pratishthan
        and M Prakash with great enthusiasm!
