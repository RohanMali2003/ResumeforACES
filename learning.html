        <h4>1. Web development! <br> I am currently learning React and am eager to test out the same! I am following
            Colt Steele's "The Web Developer Bootcamp 2024" on Udemy<br>
            It is a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to becoming a developer and features many exciting technologies
            such as React, Node, Express and MongoDB!<br>
            I hope to complete the course soon and hone my skills. I am sure, this will help me in executing my duties
            better in the Web team!
        </h4>
        <h4>2. Machine Leaning: I have just started following the exciting new field of machine learning! I am currently
            using kaggle as a resource to pursue a certificate course in the same!</h4>
        <h4>3. The guitar: Didn't expect that? :P <br> I have taken up the daunting task of learning the guitar. I still
            suck at it, but hopefully I can be better with consistent practice!</h4>
