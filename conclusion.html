        <h4>Hey, this is Rohan, signing off. I hope you enjoyed my take on the resume, I felt that it was a fun new way
            to present what is usually a boring and tedious task<br>
            And it helps showcase my skills as well! :) <br>
            I know this site is a little inconsistent at times and I'm sorry for the same. I built this in three hours
            and my highly caffeinated, sleep deprived brain is begging me to stop!<br>
            I would love to join Aces, particularly the Web team and the Technical team. I hope this resume and my
            application were satisfactory, and I eagerly look forward to being a member! :)
